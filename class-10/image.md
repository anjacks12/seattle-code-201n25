# Images

- Jpeg — the most versile file type. Use for most of your photos.
- png — take more memory than a jpeg. But you get a better quality image. 
  - use for graphics (things with text)
  - images that require invisablity
- gif — good for short animations.
- svg — vector based so they are very good for graphics logos ... things without photos
