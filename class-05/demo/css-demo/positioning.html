  <section>
    <div id="one">
      <h2>Position: relative</h2>
      <p>
        It will display exactly the same as before (position static) until you also assign its position using: left, right, top or bottom. This will position it that distance relative to its original position.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="two">
      <h2>Position: absolute</h2>
      <p>
        This element displays relative to its most recent parent element with positioning set. If it has no positioned parent, it will display relative to the page window. 
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="three">
      <h2>Position: Fixed</h2>
      <p>
        This will position the element relative to the viewport window. It will stay in the same place even if the page scrolls. Be careful!
        It can block content on your page unless you account for it by adding padding or margin to other elements.
